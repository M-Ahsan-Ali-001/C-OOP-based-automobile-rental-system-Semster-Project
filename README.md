# 1. Abstract
 We have made Automobile and Bike rental system program, in this program we have 
made four class, one is Abstract class and other three are inherited classes, we have also 
made some virtual functions. We have also made Sign-up and Login-in system for our 
program; user can make an account, or he/she can login to their account. User can delete 
his / her booking and can re-book a vehicle. 
# 2. Introduction of your project
We have designed a motorcycle and Automobile rental system software based 
on concept of Abstract class and Inheritance; we have created different Classes 
for different type of vehicles.
# 3. Methodology/ Plan development to solve the Problem.
In the beginning we have made an abstract class which has different virtual 
function and a pure virtual function, id_ password. We have also made three 
inherited classes, Car, Truck, and bike. In those classes we have made 
different function for different companies like in Car class we have made 
different Companies string array like Mehran, Corolla, Honda, Suzuki. 
Similarly In truck and bike classes we have made different function string 
arrays. We also used if-else and switch structure to check the desired vehicle 
availability. In main function we have made a pointer array object of abstract
class so that we can use other classes functions. 
# 4. Specifications
We have made Login and signup system for the user, our program first asks the 
user to login or sign up, for signing up user cannot take a name which is already 
taken by another user, after signing up user can choose a vehicle which he/she 
want to select after that user can delete the booking and can re-book a vehicle 
again. User can also check his/her detail of booking and ID. We have also made 
logout button which clears the screen. If a vehicle is already booked by another 
user, the program prints that “This vehicle is already Taken by someone please 
select other vehicle”.
